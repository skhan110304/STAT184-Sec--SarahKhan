Within this repo, I have added two dadset files as well as an R file to show an example of an assignment that I have done. There are two folders within this repo, one of them is names 'code' and the other is named 'data'. The names of the data files are self explanatory, so I have placed the R file that creates a line plot visualization in the 'code' folder and the datasets in the 'data' foder. The datasets i included in the data folder are the hypoxia data, and the oreo data that we used for both in-class demonstration, as well as other assignments that were previously done in this course. The purpose of having all of this in the directory is so that I can organize some of my files better, adn to store my final projet for this course in my STAT184-Specific repository
