Within this repo, I have added a dataset as well as an R file to show an example of an assignment that I have done. There are two folders within this repo, one of them is names 'code' and the other is named 'data'. The names of the data files are self explanatory, so I have placed the R file that creates a line plot visualization in the 'code' folder and the datasets in the 'data' foder. The code incldues the data visualization for seeing the popularity of 3 different baby names over the years, ranging from early 19th century to now. The dataset I included in the data folder is the BabyNames as a csv to practice converting and using different datasets from different file formats. The purpose of having all of this in the directory is so that I can organize some of my files better, adn to store my final projet for this course in my STAT184-Specific repository and showcase part of the assignments I have done.
